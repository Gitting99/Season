Our baldie is the best manager for United in the Post-Fergie Era.
For-The first time in the post-Sir Alex Era, I can boldly say am proud and on board with Uniteds summer transfers so far. Both the ins & outs!
However, there's still a long way to go in order to re-establish our dominance and bring back the glory days!
